Hello and wellcome to my ePortfolio!

Here you will find pages containing my self assesment and narratives for the code I have produced during my last class at SNHU. 

Please feel free to take a look around. Enjoy!

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
